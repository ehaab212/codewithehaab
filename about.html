      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>I’m Ehaab Ullah, a passionate and certified web developer with a strong background in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WordPress, and UI/UX design. I enjoy turning ideas into real, functional, and visually appealing websites that help individuals and businesses grow online.

Currently, I’m in the final semester of my BS in Software Engineering. Alongside my degree, I’ve completed a certified training in Advanced Web Development through NAVTTC, which gave me practical experience working on real-world projects. I’ve built websites for eCommerce stores, personal portfolios, and educational platforms, always focusing on clean design, mobile responsiveness, and user experience.

I also have experience in WordPress and WooCommerce customization, allowing me to create dynamic, easy-to-manage websites for clients. With an eye for design, I often use tools like Canva and Photoshop to create custom graphics and layouts that align with modern web standards.

I’m currently open to freelance, remote, or internship opportunities where I can apply my skills, learn new technologies, and contribute to exciting projects. I’m always eager to grow, solve problems creatively, and be part of a team that values innovation and quality.</p>
